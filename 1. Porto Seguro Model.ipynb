    "# Porto Seguro ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Porto Seguro, one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, completely agrees. Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction), the challenge is to **build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year**.\n",
    "While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they’re looking to Kaggle’s machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky for you, a machine learning model was built to solve the Porto Seguro problem by the data scientist on your team. The solution notebook has steps to load data, split the data into test and train sets, train, evaluate and save a LightGBM model that will be used for the future challenges.\n",
